  \frametitle{Benchmarks : Overview}
  This suite of benchmark problems is designed to test Cyclus' build
  directive and gross material flows.

  VISION is not a discrete material code, thus approximations must be made.
  As per Kyle Oliver's masters thesis, the following parameters are used:

  Note that using these parameters, a full core loading is 1.273 tHM.

  Each simulation begins in the year 2000 and is run for 100 years. The decay 
  module in Cyclus has been turned off in order to compare results with given
  data.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Problem 1 - 1 Reactor
      \begin{itemize}
        \item A single reactor is ordered in 2000, decommissioning at the end
          of its lifetime
      \end{itemize}
    \item Problem 2 - 10 Reactors
      \begin{itemize}
        \item 10 such reactors are ordered
      \end{itemize}
    \item Problem 3 - Linear Growth
      \begin{itemize}
        \item 1 reactor per year is built
        \item Note: 2 reactors are built in years that old reactors retire
      \end{itemize}
    %% \item Problem 4 - Exponential Growth
    %%   \begin{itemize}
    %%     \item Reactors are built in order to meet an increased electrical demand
    %%       of 2\% per year
    %%     \item Initial demand is 10 GWe
    %%     \item Initially, 10 legacy reactors exist
    %%     \item One legacy reactor per year is decommissioned starting in 2029
    %%   \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
