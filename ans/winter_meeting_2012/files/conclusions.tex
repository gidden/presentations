  \frametitle{Conclusions : Key Takeaways}
  Cyclus is designed to be a platform upon which many (any) fuel 
  cycle can be investigated. This platform is open, free, and is easy
  to expand/contribute to.

  \vspace{0.2cm}

  The modularity in Cyclus allows us to isolate and identify 
  differences between fuel cycles. This allows us to discuss these 
  differences with a common language, rather than having to translate
  between many different simulators.

  \frametitle{Conclusions : Future Work}
  There's still lots to be done:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Discuss with VISION team
    \item Profile existing code
    \item Add recycle capability
    \item Explore more fuel cycle option space
  \end{itemize}
  Cyclus is open source, feel free to join us!
