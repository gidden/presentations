  \frametitle{Introduction : Purpose}
  Fuel cycle simulators are designed to answer policy-related questions
  regarding transitions from one equilibrium state to another.

  \vspace{0.2cm}

  \pause
  A simulator answers the following questions as a function of its 
  parameter space:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item how much material exists
    \item where does that material reside
    \item from/to where and when is material transported
    \item what kinds of facilities are needed
    \item when is each type of facility needed
  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Introduction : Simulators Today}
  In general, simulators differ in the following respects
  \begin{itemize}
    \item material flows: continuous or discrete
    \item facility deployment: individual or fleet-based
    \item regional modeling
  \end{itemize}
  \pause
  Some codes currently in use today:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item VISION (INL)
    \item NUWASTE (NWTRB)
    \item CAFCA (MIT)
    \item DANESS (ANL)
    \item NFCSim (LANL)
    \item COSI (CEA)
    \item MARKAL (BNL)
  \end{itemize}
  ... to name a few.

  \frametitle{Introduction : VISION}
  VISION has surfaced as the industry standard simulator. It is well
  represented in the literature and can model most aspects of the
  fuel cycle. \cite{yacout_vision_2006}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item continuous material flows
    \item fleet-based facility deployment
    \item some regional modeling capability
    \item input/output via Excel
    \item simulation engine via Powersim
  \end{itemize}
  However, Powersim has its limitations...
  \begin{itemize}
    \item variables as a function of software level... did you get the academic or professional version?
    \item it's (relatively) expensive
    \item it's third party software
  \end{itemize}
