  \frametitle{The Budget Making Process: Steps}
  The budget making process is, to say the least, involved.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item President makes a budget request
      \begin{itemize}
        \item formulated by OMB
        \item IUP generally not in it
      \end{itemize}
    \pause
    \item Congress makes a budget resolution (like a guideline)
    \pause
    \item Congressional committees make authorizations (policy)
      \begin{itemize}
        \item IUP language introduced in 2009
        \item \$450M over 10 years split between ONE, NRC, NNSA
      \end{itemize}
    \pause
    \item Appropriations committee appropriates (funds)
  \end{enumerate}
  \pause
  The budget is then voted on and sent to the President. 
  The end result can be:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Appropriations Bills from Committees
    \item Omnibus Bill (bring on the pork)
    \item Continuing Resolution
      \begin{itemize}
        \item occurs if no bill is signed into law by the end of 
          the fiscal year
        \item keeps funding at the same level as previous
        \item all of FY11 was a continuing resolution 
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
